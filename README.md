# My-Portfolio
This is a website on which I am able to get my name out there for others to have an idea of what I do. It allows me to share my skillset which could help me contribute to the world of technology.

Huge shoutout to Lukas (https://www.pexels.com/@goumbik/), U.Lucas Dub√©-Cantin (https://www.pexels.com/@lucasdc/), Kevin Ku (https://www.pexels.com/@kevin-ku-92347/), and Sora Shimazaki (https://www.pexels.com/@sora-shimazaki/) for the use of their free pictures to help make my website look a whole lot better.
